# ECE143_Project

The dataset source is from: https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-calls-for-service/


This project aims to analyze the dataset of police calls for service dispatched by the San Diego Police
Departmentâ€™s communications dispatch center. A police call service dataset can provide valuable insights into
various aspects of public safety, law enforcement, and community well-being. The dataset contains various
attributes such as incident number, date/time, day of the week, location details, call type, disposition, beat,
and priority. This enriched dataset can allow us to explore a variety of patterns behind police call service.
By analyzing this dataset, we aim to identify hotspots for different types of incidents, peak times for calls,
and potentially uncover any patterns related to specific call types or areas.

Include a readme file that explains your file structure, how to run your code, and name all third-party modules you are using.
